# My blog

This is my personal cybersecurity blog. I post here useful things that I learn, notes I take and bugs I find.  
The theme used is derived from [Artem Sheludko's](http://artemsheludko.com/) work. Feel free to use this theme for your blog too.  
The site is generated with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages at [this link](https://teodor440.github.io/blog/). I also host my [portfolio](https://teodor440.github.io/blog/about/) along with my blog.
